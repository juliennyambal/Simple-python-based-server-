# Simple-python-based-server-

Just run this from a terminal (Linux):

- python 2.x: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer ```
- python 3.x: ```python -m http.server ```

Your system will be serving on '0.0.0.0:8000', unless that port is already used.

Then, the sweet part is when your grab your system's ip with the port 8080 to share files or do something more important, like sharing files. :))

Enjoy!!!
